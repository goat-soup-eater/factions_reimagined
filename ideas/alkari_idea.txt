technological society

emperor is rational atheist materialist

Originally, the alkari emperor was supposed to be a time traveler from a future where the galaxy was invaded/sterilized by extragalactic invaders like the reapers from mass effect. The emperor having knowledge of advanced technologies, elevated medieval alkari society to spacefaring civilization much earlier than it was supposed to so that they could develop a technological advantage by the time the extragalactic armada arrives. When finding other alien races, the emperor's goal would be to unify the galaxy as soon as possible to not waste time on politics. That concept was thrown away due to the complexity of such a scenario, and the dialogue (written with the original concept in mind) was rewritten.
