megastructural engineers

a wise man once said: is there something more glorious than the sight of a construction site running straight to the horizon?
you answer: the sight of a construction site bigger than an entire star.

the glory of the conquest of an environment as harsh as space is as you see now, larger than any that can be earned in battle.
