The [race] Hive
The year is 3107...
It has been more than three thousand years since the Hive awakened.
In those three thousand years the Hive has changed much. From groups of weak, delicate drones, eeking out an existence in the dangerous environment of Kholdan, to something that was no longer subjected to the whims of it's environment, but could in fact, manipulate and shape it as it wished.
Though the Hive experienced some failures along the way, such as the unexpected side-effects of the invention of factories and the ecological upheaval that resulted from it, before ways to contain the waste were invented, the rapid technological advancement was otherwise entirely benefitial to the Hive.
With the thought-drones finally finding a way to bend the laws of physics and travel faster than the speed of light, the Hive must now colonize the stars once unreachable.
The strategy-drones see that the Hive's future has two paths - either the Hive will secure dominance in this galaxy and then spread to the rest of the universe, or the Hive will fall to it's enemies, who, judging by the predators the Hive has seen on Kholdan, will be unlikely to show mercy.
The Hive must do everything in it's power to ensure it ends with the former. 
Failure is not an option.
