The Human Federation
The year is 2300...
It has been more than three centuries since the Old Humanity commited collective suicide by global thermonuclear war, reducing most of the planet to cinders as well as taking most of their knowledge and culture with them.
The survivors of this planetary cataclysm were few and scattered, as all major cities were hit and those that were not could not protect their population from the effects of nuclear fallout, chaos and starvation resulting from their dependence on the now non-existent global supply chains.
Out of this hostile environment, a new civilization would struggle to arise. But as the effects of the war slowly dissipated and the new civilization's knowledge increased, the long and arduous process of building the world from ground up would begin.
The adoption of a bold, newly-created worldview among the survivors would lead to the creation of the first global government in human history, the Federation. The focus of it's leaders would be to act in the best interests of the human race, and to ensure it's prosperity and survival.
Now that the majority of the world's problems have been solved, infrastructure rebuilt, undesirables terminated and science even more advanced than before the War, a signal that confirms without a shadow of a doubt the existence of other sapient races has been discovered, and humanity is ready to become an interstellar civilization.
