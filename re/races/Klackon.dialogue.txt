CONTACT_AGGRESSIVE         | The Hive has found an alien life-form. Life-form is not Hive-like? ... Unexpected. The Hive must develop an alternative approach...
CONTACT_RUTHLESS           | The Hive has initiated first contact with alien life-form... a life-form that is not Hive-like? Defying logic... The Hive must contemplate it's next course of action...
CONTACT_XENOPHOBIC         | The Hive has discovered an alien life-form. One completely unlike the Hive... Anomalous. The Hive knows better than to trust anomalous entities... The Hive must re-evaluate it's approach...
//
GREETING_01                | The Hive greets you, [your_race], and listens to you...
GREETING_04                | The Hive has been contacted by an alien life-form...
GREETING_07                | The Hive does not like you. Speak quickly...
//

DECLAREWAR_HATE_01         | The Hive is not a passive entity, [your_race]. When it is bothered it responds accordingly, and in this case the Hive will respond to your actions, rather harshly...
DECLAREWAR_HATE_02         | The Hive must be creating an illusion of weakness for life-forms like you to commit such actions. However, the Hive remains as powerful as ever and will show this to the entire galaxy at your expense, [your_race]...
DECLAREWAR_HATE_03         | The Hive can tolerate many things. You, however, are not one of them, [your_race]. Not a single strand of your DNA will be left in this galaxy by the time the Hive has finished...
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_01      | The Hive wishes for closer relations with you, [your_race]. The Hive's simulations show that a violent confrontation now might bring you and the Hive closer together in the long-term...
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_02      | The Hive finds non-Hive-like life-forms... difficult... to understand. The Hive hopes that a conflict with you will bring about valuable insight into [your_race] psychology...
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_03      | The Hive decided that you are a potential threat to the survival of the Hive in the long-term. Even if not, the Hive is not willing to tolerate uncertainty, especially when it concerns it's own survival...
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_01     | The Hive must expand or die, [your_race]. That lesson The Hive has learned long ago. Now the period of peaceful expansion has ended and the Hive must use... less peaceful methods. Understand that there is no other choice...
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_02     | The Hive requires new worlds for it's drones. Your worlds look like they will serve the Hive well. The Hive shall take them for itself...
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_03     | The Hive has disliked you for quite some time, [your_race]. Now that the Hive requires new territory, it can repay you for your actions while benefitting itself...
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_01     | The Hive considers the [other_race] a part of the Hive itself. And the Hive defends itself when threatened, [your_race]... a fact you should have learned much earlier...
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_02     | The Hive would not make an Alliance with the [other_race] to abandon them at the first sign of disturbance. The Hive will gladly help the [other_race] in their war, whatever the cost may be...
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_03     | The Hive is not impressed with your attempts at showing dominance. You must think that because you look strong you can do whatever you please? Wrong. The Hive will show you now, what happens when you bother it's allies...
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_01       | The Hive's drones see all. Including your spies. Since you never removed them, even in spite of it's warnings, the Hive sees no choice but to declare open conflict...
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_02       | The Hive is... irritated... by your spies. You put them everywhere, in the breeding chambers, the industrial spires, the thinking rooms... Since you could not remove your spies by yourself, the Hive will do it for you by declaring conflict...
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_03       | The Hive does not threaten others casually, [your_race]. Perhaps you should have paid attention to the Hive's warnings about your spies while you had the time...
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_01       | The Hive does not desire unnecessary conflict and thought that you felt the same way. But now that you have attacked the Hive it is obvious what your true desire is. Fear not, [your_race], for the Hive shall give you what you are yearning for, very soon...
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_02       | The Hive has acknowledged your unprovoked attack. It shall pay it back to you a thousand-fold...
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_03       | The Hive does not feel emotions in the sense that... less advanced life-forms like you do, but even it is enraged by your actions, [your_race]. Prepare for an armed response...
DECLAREWAR_OPPORTUNITY_01  | The Hive is presented with an opportunity to wipe you out swiftly and efficiently. Only an evolutionary failure would not capitalize on an availaible opportunity, especially since it weakens the opposition...
DECLAREWAR_ASSASSIN_01     | The Hive has been attacked recently, [your_race]. By you. The Hive's thought-drones have found that the optimal strategy in almost any situation is to respond the same way your opponent did. The Hive shall do so immediately...

OFFER_PEACE_01             | The Hive wishes for this... war... to end, [your_race]. So much death and destruction has been caused, yet whether the end-goal can be accomplished remains unclear. The Hive proposes to cease all hostilities... for now...
OFFER_TRADE_01             | The Hive has little understanding of what you call "economics", yet it understands that by creating a trade treaty both the Hive and the [your_race] can benefit. The Hive proposes to start at [amt] BC per year...
OFFER_PACT_01              | The Hive would neither wish nor would benefit from a conflict with you at this time, [your_race]. The Hive thus proposes a Non-Aggression Pact. Whether you will agree to it or not remains unknown for now, however...
OFFER_ALLIANCE_01          | The Hive's strategy-drones have found that without allies the Hive will likely fall to it's enemies. The Hive thus proposes to build an Alliance with you, as you have been relatively co-operative with the Hive. The only thing left is your approval...
 
WARN_TRESPASSING_01        | The Hive finds your presense in the [system] star system... worrying. Leave at once, or the Hive will be forced to respond...  
WARN_EXPANSION_01          | The Hive knows that all entities must either expand or die, but the pace of your expansion is concerning. You must slow down your expansion to a more reasonable speed if you do not wish for a conflict with the Hive...
WARN_BUILDUP_01            | The Hive has noticed that your shipyards have suddenly started brimming with activity, [your_race]. You are expanding your starfleet, are you not? The Hive advises you to slow this process down, or others might react... less than positively...
WARN_SKIRMISH_01           | The Hive has noted the incident at the [system] primary. The Hive does not desire a conflict with the [your_race] at this time, as long as this remains a lone incident...
WARN_ATTACKED_01           | The Hive finds your recent actions puzzling, [your_race]. It does not see the motives behind your recent actions. While the thought-drones are searching for an answer to this anomaly, be warned - the Hive will respond to further attacks... more actively...
WARN_INVADED_01            | The Hive has observed your recent invasion of it's colony in the [system] star system, [your_race]. While not much was lost, an act of aggression was still commited. Make sure this never happens again, or the Hive make you suffer, like you made it...
WARN_ESPIONAGE_01          | The Hive seeks knowledge, yet it does not take kindly when others take it for themselves like it is theirs. If you wanted to know the secrets you stole from the Hive so badly you could have tried to research them yourself. Continuing this way would be... regrettable for you. [framed]
WARN_SABOTAGE_01           | The Hive, as any other entity capable of common sense, would recognize your destruction of Hive infrastructure as what it is: an act of aggression. The Hive will tolerate this for now, as little of value was lost, but be warned: continuing will force the Hive to retaliate...
WARN_BIOWEAPON_01          | The Hive finds the biological weaponry used at the [system] star system to be... disturbing, strange it may be. The weapon is not so different from conventional bombs, but the amount of death it causes is... high, to say the least. The Hive will be more wary of you from now on, [your_race]...
WARN_GENOCIDE_01           | The Hive has found out that the life-form it calls the [victim_race] has been completely exterminated... By you. The Hive did accidentally cause the extinction of several races on Kholdan, but never anything close to such a scale! The Hive wonders if you could do something similar to itself...
WARN_FINAL_WAR_01          | The Hive finds this a strange action, [your_race]. The Galaxy will soon be unified under a single conciousness, spreading harmony and benefiting all in it, yet, you... reject the ruling? ... An entity so illogical and erratic must be removed as soon as possible. Starting right now...
WARN_COUNCIL_VOTE_01       | The Hive only wishes to assimilate the rest of the Galaxy into itself. Why is the [your_race] against this? Are you against the harmony and benefit it would bring? If you know what is best for you, you will change your mind by the next meeting...
WARN_OATHBREAKER_01        | The Hive can no longer trust you, [your_race]. It will change it's behavior towards you accordingly...
WARN_ATTACKED_ALLY_01      | The Hive does not wish to enter a conflict at this time, [your_race]. You must stop your attacks on the Hive's friend the [defender_race] if you do not wish to earn the Hive's dislike...
WARN_REBELLING_AGAINST_01  | The Hive cannot allow this! The peace this "Galactic Council" claims it will bring is false! Only the assimilation of the Galaxy as one entity can there be lasting peace! The Hive could not do so diplomatically... perhaps an aggressive approach could work...

PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_01     | The Hive sees that the [voter_race] is one of the few entities in this "Council", that recognizes the truth for what it is: only by assimilating the Galaxy into a single conciousness can peace be achieved. And you are wise to think so...
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_02     | The Hive is... grateful, that you are helping it achieve dominance over this "Council". It is a good thing that you did so: not only for the Hive, but for yourself as well, for the future the Hive is building will benefit all. Including you...
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_03     | The Hive finds your support of it in the so-called "Council" strange, given your previous behavior. Are you trying to change what it thinks of you, or do you truly believe in the Hive's cause? Either way, the Hive has benefited...
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_01   | The Hive simply by itself was already a strong enemy for the [defender_race], but with the [your_race] fighting alongside the Hive the [defender_race] barely stand a chance...
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_02   | The Hive thanks you for your support in it's conflict against the [defender_race]. With the [your_race] assisting the Hive, this conflict will be resolved much more quickly...
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_03   | The Hive... did not expect... the [your_race], out of all entities in this vast cosmos, to fight the [defender_race]. The Hive will remember this, but know that this changes the Hive's opinion on you very little...
PRAISE_TRADE_01            | The Hive has not expected such a boost in productivity on it's worlds to be enabled by this trade treaty. Yet it is a pleasant anomaly and the Hive will utilize it...
PRAISE_TRADE_02            | The Hive's analysis-drones have tinkered and experimented with the trade goods it received and it has learned much information. Even without the productivity boost, the data the Hive has learned alone makes the treaty worth it...
PRAISE_REBELLING_WITH_01   | The Hive too recognizes that the Council has to be removed. You are not alone, [your_race], in your desire to not conform to this "New Republic". And the Hive will gladly assist you in exterminating it....

DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_02           | The Hive will listen...

DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | The Hive has more important things to do...
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | The Hive cannot prioritize every little problem... other matters must be solved now...


DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | The Hive will not accept your offer if you cannot keep them...
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | The Hive cannot trust you any longer with all the treaties you have broken...
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | The Hive must trust the [your_race] after they broke so many treaties? An incorrect assumption...
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | The Hive sees little value in conducting diplomacy with an entity that does not keep it's own promises...
DECLINE_OATHBREAKER_01     | The Hive will not deal with those who cannot even keep their treaties...

DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | The Hive has not forgotten how you stole it's secrets, [your_race]...
DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | The Hive develops technology for itself, not other life-forms. Cease your spying, then the Hive may consider your offer...

DECLINE_ESPIONAGE_01       | The Hive must agree to your proposals even though you stole it's technologies? No... That is not how the Hive operates...

DECLINE_SABOTAGE_01        | The Hive wonders why it must deal with you after you sabotaged it's colonies...
DECLINE_SABOTAGE_01        | The Hive would like to consider your proposal, but your sabotage of it's colonies makes that impossible for now...

DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | The Hive will not consider your proposal until you stop your buildup of starships near it's planets...
DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | The Hive asks you to remove your ships from it's borders. Otherwise the Hive will not deal with you...
DECLINE_BUILDUP_01         | The Hive is not moved a centimeter by your not-so-subtle attempt at intimidation. But it has certainly changed it's willingness to cooperate with you...

DECLINE_SKIRMISH_01        | The Hive asks you to leave it's vessels alone. Until then the Hive will not listen to your proposals.... 
DECLINE_SKIRMISH_01        | The Hive does not produce vessels out of thin breathing gas. The Hive does not appreciate it's investments being destroyed...

RESPOND_BREAK_TRADE_01     | The Hive will remember this...
