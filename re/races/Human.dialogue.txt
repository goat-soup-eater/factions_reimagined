CONTACT_HONORABLE          | The Federation greets your people, [your_name]. I and my colleagues represent the [my_race] race. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.
CONTACT_PACIFIST           | We greet you, fellow brothers-in-intelligence. We are the [my_race] race, and we hope for a bright, peaceful future of mutual cooperation with your people.
CONTACT_ERRATIC            | The Federation is a flexible governing body. We solve problems - efficiently. Some require force. Others do not. Whether you will be a problem, and whether you will require the use of force to solve - is unknown.
//
GREETING_01                | The Federation is more than happy to see you! I thought you should know that [your_race] culture is quite popular on many of our worlds. In any case, how can I and my colleagues help you today, friend?
GREETING_04                | The Federal Council is full of various differing opinions about your people, like it always is about everything, ambassador. What is it you wish to discuss today?
GREETING_07                | Ah. The [your_race_plural] and their ambassador. How quaint. I assume you contacted the Federation for a reason. State it.
//
DECLAREWAR_HATE_01         | Everything comes at a price, ambassador. We the [my_race_plural] must continually pay a terrible price if we wish for our society to survive. It is unfortunate, but everything deemed incompatible with our civilization must be... wiped out. Your race is one of those things.
DECLAREWAR_HATE_02         | Just as the [your_empire] must protect [your_race] interests, the [my_empire] must protect [my_race] interests. Your race has been threatening the interests of [my_race] civilization for quite some time now. Thus it must be... removed.
DECLAREWAR_HATE_03         | We [my_race_plural] have thought that genocide and war in general were terrible things ever since we almost wiped ourselves out as a species because of them. Yet the existence of your species has forced us to reconsider this notion.

DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_01      | Throughout many [my_race] worlds pacifism has been spreading. That is problematic because given the universe we live in a species must be able to defend itself. A quick war and propaganda campaign against your people will hopefully solve the problem quickly.
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_02      | The Science Council has just realized your people have much knowledge inside their brains that could, if extracted, advance technology to undreamed levels. Even in death you will further our interests, [your_race]. For science!
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_03      | We see through your false smile, ambassador. We value peace, yet since we cannot trust you and cannot verify your intentions, we must put moral concerns aside and oversee the complete extermination of the [your_race] species from this galaxy.
//
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_01     | It truly is a shame we have failed to find a way to make you give up your territory to the Federation peacefully, ambassador. Perhaps then, this war could have been avoided.
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_02     | As technology advances, the comfort required by the human population rises as well. The amount of resources needed to satisfy them rises too. Your resources look like they could raise the quality of life greatly, so we will be taking them from you.
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_03     | We will do everything in our power to ensure that Human civilization, not [your_race], dominates this galaxy now and always! Nothing is off the table to ensure our prosperity.
//
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_01     | We act in the best interests of Humanity, but that does not mean we cannot cooperate with other races. In fact, it is very much the opposite. The [other_race_plural] request our help in repelling the [your_race] scourge, and we have the full intention of helping them.
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_02     | It was not a wise decision to get on the bad side of the [other_race_plural], ambassador. Surely you know that they are our ally and we must now join them in their war?
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_03     | The [other_race_plural] have earned Humanity's trust and respect. You have not. Now that we are forced to choose between the [your_race_plural] and the [other_race_plural], we choose the [other_race_plural].
//
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_01       | Unlike what you seem to have been thinking when you started spying on us, just because we do not like war does not mean we will not declare one. You will learn this first-hand now, alien...
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_02       | It is most dissapointing that one of the only things in which your civilization is similar to ours is using underhanded tactics like spying to achieve success. And you would have, if only you picked a target other than Humanity. Now the only thing you have achieved is ensuring your own demise.
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_03       | Your spying has gone too far! Since you did not stop after our warnings, the only way to deal with the problem now is to remove the source - your species.
//
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_01       | We would expect such a brazen attack from our worst enemies, yet for it to come from a race we once trusted and considered partners is a hundred times worse! We will see to it that your kind is exterminated, [your_race], for what your people did today!
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_02       | Your kind has made a powerful enemy today, alien. Perhaps you will remember this moment when your worlds burn and your people are made extinct...
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_03       | Our people survived countless catastrophes, cataclysms and mass extinction events. As we stand united there is no threat that we will not be able to defeat, no challenge we will not overcome. Your attack today only serves to motivate us to defeat you harder.
//
DECLAREWAR_OPPORTUNITY_01  | We did not want this, alien. Your kind poses virtually no threat to our own and should have been able to peacefully coexist. But that seems to not be possible. Do not fret, however. I will see to it personally that your kind will be forever remembered as a necessary sacrifice for human progress.
DECLAREWAR_ASSASSIN_01     | Human life being priceless is the idea our entire society is based on! And you choose to murder our ambassador?! You will pay for the blood you spilled today most dearly, alien. 

OFFER_PEACE_01             | This war has shown us many things. It has shown us that we were wrong about your people on many levels and that both our species can coexist in this galaxy. Let us never repeat this again, by signing a Peace Treaty and creating a future where we will see each other as partners instead of bitter enemies. The choice is yours.
OFFER_TRADE_01             | We have detected an opportunity for mutual gain, ambassador. Our great civilizations both have various equally great ideas. What if we were to exchange those ideas in the form of trade goods? Say, starting at [amt] BC per year?
OFFER_PACT_01              | Trust and good relations are all well and good, but they are not backed up by anything (not that we wish to imply we do not trust you). Let us bind ourselves to a Pact of Non-Aggression, to ensure a safe, peaceful, prosperous future for both our species. What do you say?
OFFER_ALLIANCE_01          | We sense a great opportunity, ambassador. While the other races waste their time fighting for petty causes, our relationship with you has been nothing short of fantastic! Both our civilizations are titans of industry and might - if we unite in an Alliance, nobody would be able to stop us! We await your response.

WARN_TRESPASSING_01        | Hello, ambassador. As leaders of the Federation, it is our duty to protect all [my_race] citizens. We take this mission very seriously and are thus concerned that one of your fleets is located in orbit around one of our colonies. We ask you to remove it.
WARN_EXPANSION_01          | Greetings, ambassador. Your recent colonization initiatives are... worrying. We all know fully well that the amount of space in this galaxy is not infinite. Please... think about the way your stellar neighbors might... react, before planning to settle yet another world.
WARN_BUILDUP_01            | Ahem. Your military buildup has not gone unnoticed, ambassador. Do not assume that because humanity wishes peace we are not able to defend ourselves. It is quite the opposite. Now, would you kindly stop, or at least, slow down your shipbuilding? Before any... misunderstandings occur.
WARN_SKIRMISH_01           | You were lucky those ships were automated! We value human life very highly, ambassador - if this repeats and has casualties, we will take severe measures!
WARN_ATTACKED_01           | You did what?! You attacked us at [system]?! ... I have received reports that the crew of those starships managed to reach the escape pods. This makes this situation much less... tense. This, however, does not change the fact that you will stop immediately if you do not wish for war.
WARN_INVADED_01            | So you invaded our colony on [system]. You were very lucky those colonists were undesirables and were meant to be disposed of anyway after our xenobiological experiments concluded. If they were not, however, we would be glassing your planets and exterminating your people.
WARN_ESPIONAGE_01          | Is your science so lacking you must resort to stealing technologies from others to keep up with progress? Or did you have some other reason? Regardless, we should not need to explain to you that continuing this would not be good for our diplomatic relations, [your_race]. [framed]
WARN_SABOTAGE_01           | Do you even know how many colonists were injured from your sabotage attempt?! We care little for that building you blew up, but if you ever try something like this again and it results in even a single casualty there will be very heavy consequences for you!
WARN_BIOWEAPON_01          | We saw what you did at [system], as did the entire galaxy. Do not think we will ever forget this use of biological weapons and the implications it carries with it.
WARN_GENOCIDE_01           | Do not think you will get away with your genocide of the [victim_race]! This is no minor thing the galaxy will soon forget, and we will ensure it stays that way!
WARN_FINAL_WAR_01          | It is clear that your unwillingness to join the new galactic order is only due to your hate and contempt of humanity and the very concept of peaceful coexistence. Another interstellar war means nothing in the face of the possibility of a safe and secure galactic society. Rest assured, you will soon come to regret this.
WARN_COUNCIL_VOTE_01       | Have you accidentally pressed the wrong button, ambassador? We would like to remind you that our platform is a peaceful and stable galactic society. Only a fool or a warmonger would be against that.
WARN_OATHBREAKER_01        | The way you treat binding treaties and agreenments like garbage reveals to all exactly what you think of your neighbors. 
WARN_ATTACKED_ALLY_01      | The Federal Starfleet is obligated to defend the Federation AND it's allies. The [defender_race_plural] are our allies and if you do not stop your pointless aggression toward them, we will soon be forced to respond.
WARN_REBELLING_AGAINST_01  | The Federation DOES NOT consent to this... joke. Do you really think that anyone but Overseer [my_name] can lead the galaxy to a peaceful and prosperous future? We will not allow any false leader to lead this entire galaxy and by extention, humanity, and we are prepared to fight for our beliefs!
//
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_01     | Hello, ambassador! We sincirely thank you for voting for us. Rest assured, your kind will be comfortable under our new galactic order, when it will be formed. I will make sure of it, personally.
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_02     | A vote for [my_name] is a vote for a peaceful, prosperous future full of wonders. It is a shame that we have not yet been elected, but I am sure it will happen soon enough.
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_03     | So you wish to gain our trust? A vote for us is indeed quite useful, but you will need to work harder than that if you wish to become our friends.

PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_01   | We thank you for your help in our extermination campaign of the [defender_race] race. It has allowed us to minimize the loss of human life caused by those savage xenos greatly. In return, we will aid you in minimizing your own losses.
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_02   | It is good that you see the necessity of this genocide. Your assistance will not be forgotten, not now, not in the far future.
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_03   | So you too recognize the threat of the [defender_race] race and are willing to act against them? We may have got the wrong impression about you after all.

PRAISE_TRADE_01            | Oh, this is excellent. Your trade goods are very popular here on [my_race] worlds, they have enriched our culture AND our coffers! And we hope our trade goods did the same to you.
PRAISE_TRADE_02            | This trade not only creates much prosperity for both our peoples, it gives an excellent incentive to maintain peaceful relations and cooperate. 

PRAISE_REBELLING_WITH_01   | With the way they reacted to a single case of doubt about such a great change is evidence enough that these council madmen ought to be destroyed! We realize who the true warmongers are in this galaxy. As soon as they are out of the way, a new age may begin - an age of progress and TRUE peaceful coexistence between our peoples.

DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_01           | We are listening.
DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_02           | Speak your mind, but please try to be brief. We do not have much time.
DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_03           | What do you want? Are you trying to provoke a reaction? In that case we will have to dissapoint you.
DIPLO_TECH_REQUEST_MENU_01   | We have many interesting technologies. Surely some would be useful to you.
DIPLO_TECH_COUNTER_MENU_01   | Of course, you realize that we do not give technology away for free?
DIPLO_TRADE_MENU_01          | Those credits will be very useful for our economy, but we must know for how many the treaty is signed.
DIPLO_TREATY_MENU_01         | So you want to sign a treaty? Well, there are many. You need to choose which one.
DIPLO_DECLARE_WAR_MENU_01    | Are you trying to start an interstellar war?
DIPLO_SUGGEST_WAR_MENU_01    | So who do we need to declare war on?
DIPLO_BREAK_ALLIANCE_MENU_01 | It might be in our interest to break an Alliance. But with who?
DIPLO_THREATEN_MENU_01       | I suggest you stop before you do something you will regret.

DECLINE_OFFER_01           | The Federation rejects your offer.
DECLINE_OFFER_02           | We has considered your offer and rejected it.
DECLINE_OFFER_03           | The Federation declines your offer.
DECLINE_OFFER_04           | We are not interested in your offer.
DECLINE_OFFER_05           | The Federation does not consider your offer a fair one.
DECLINE_OFFER_06           | We do not think it would be in Humanity's best interests to accept this offer.
DECLINE_OFFER_07           | We reject this obviously one-sided offer.
DECLINE_OFFER_08           | The Federation does not consider this offer to be a fair one.
DECLINE_OFFER_09           | We must decline your offer.

DECLINE_ENEMY_ALLY_01      | The [other_race] race does not think highly of humanity. We do not want to associate with them.

DECLINE_ANNOYED_01         | We have other things to take care of, I'm afraid.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_01         | Diplomacy may be our strength but that does not mean it is the most important thing for the Federation.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_01         | You tire us with your trivial concerns.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_02         | We are VERY sorry to interrupt but surely this conversation can take place at a later date?
DECLINE_ANNOYED_02         | We must leave now.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_02         | We must now say goodbye.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | We have more pressing matters to attend to.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | Unfortunately we have other things to do.
DECLINE_ANNOYED_03         | We cannot concern ourselves so much with the problems of aliens.
