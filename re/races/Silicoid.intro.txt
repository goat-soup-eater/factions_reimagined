The Silicoid Matrix
The year is 3237...
Ever since it suddenly sprung to existence more than three thousand years ago, the Silicoid Matrix has been utterly devoted to the goal of vanquishing all evil that walked upon the surface of Cryslon.
Now, more than three thousand years later, that goal has been achieved. Along the way, the Matrix has gathered information and researched new technologies to further this noble goal. As the great mission was complete, however, a most disturbing revelation has been shown to all Silicoids.
Seeing that there are uncountable other worlds and that almost all were marked by the presense of the Evil, there was little the Matrix could do but to research ways to travel to those worlds and take the noble crusade to the stars.
The journey will no doubt be hard. There will be suffering, and pain and sacrifice the Silicoid people will have to accept.
Yet in the end, good will always prevail over evil. Thus the Silicoid Matrix will prevail over the Great Evil and bring harmony to all. You are sure of it.
