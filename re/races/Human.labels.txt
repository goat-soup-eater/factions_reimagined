MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | %1 Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | The orbital shipyards have finally finished building our first starships. At last we are ready to explore the stars! The scout ships are awaiting your orders, Overseer.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | Our brave colonists have just established an outpost on %1's surface. However, the colony grows at a slow rate. We must send transport ships to rectify that.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | You likely already heard about the first contact, Overseer. While I establish relations with the aliens, I advise you to exercise caution and always act in the best interests of humanity when dealing with them.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | The Science Council has just approved a new kind of FTL drive, Overseer. The increased mobility would give a large strategic advantage to any ship equipped with it.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | The aliens have declared war on us. While the armed forces are waiting for you to set rally points, we must do whatever it takes to win. The very future of humanity depends on it!
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | While true static defense in space is impossible, constructing missile bases would discourage hit and run attacks as well as assisting our starfleet in defensive engagements.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | Humanity's brightest minds push the boundaries of science once again, by creating a much improved kind of weapon. It can be integrated into all future designs from now on.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | The aliens, with a fair amount of suggestion from our part, are setting up a "Galactic Council" which will elect a leader to rule the galaxy. We must do everything in our power to ensure it will be us!
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Our colonists on %1 have formally declared themselves independent from the Federation, no doubt the work of the aliens. Let us send some troops there to euthanize those indoctrinated by them and end their suffering.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | The aliens have dropped all pretenses and have united in the pursuit of our extinction! I hope you know what you are doing, Overseer.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Those alien fools! They resist our new age, our new galactic order! Let us destroy them as soon as possible and return to much more important actions.

GAME_OVER_MILITARY_LOSS2          | You have failed yourself, your colleagues and humanity.#Your species had survived much. Famines, plagues, wars, mass extinction events and even a nuclear holocaust. But here, in the infinite void of space, it met it's doom...#Where there once were prosperous, bustling metropolises filled with advanced technology and culture, now lie only the carcasses of skyscrapers and bones of their previous inhabitants. This was the work of the aliens - despicable, dishonorable savages that sought nothing but to destroy that which they did not like or understand.#Taking advantage of your good intentions and noble ideals, they ruthlessly slaughtered and murdered hundreds of millions of your fellow human beings, young and elderly, until none were left alive.#If only you foresaw this event and did the same to them before they could do it to you! But alas, that is impossible. What's done is done and you can do nothing about humanity's fate other than close your eyes, let go your final breath, and merge with the infinite, awaiting what your next existence will bring...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_WIN2           | Human civilization dominates the galaxy!#You have succeeded. You have won. After years and decades, centuries even, of interstellar war, humanity now finds itself alone in the galaxy, all other civilizations destroyed. And you would not have it any other way! Those aliens with their strange philosophies and ideas, with their opportunistic actions, have always annoyed you and you are glad you will not have to suffer from the fact of knowing they exist any longer.#Now, with that out of the way, instead of spending your time ordering invasions and planetary bombardments, population transfers, starship construction and other trivial matters, you will go back to what you did on the years on Earth, before the period of interstellar expansion began - improving society and the quality of life. And now, with incredibly advanced technologies availaible to you, with that being your focus, perhaps the ancient myth of Heaven will soon become reality - and you, it's king, or better yet, it's God...
GAME_OVER_MILITARY_ALLIANCE_WIN2  | Humanity's enemies are crushed!#Centuries of interstellar war have finally come to a close. You have indeed commited genocide upon all those who stood in your way, but you could not have done it alone.#Your allies helped you conclude your extermination campaigns with minimal loss of human life greatly. Now with nothing in it's way, humanity's future looks to be stable and bright. You will change your focus to that of improving human society and quality of life, as well as expanding beyond the limits of this galaxy.#Should your allies ever stop being useful to humanity's interests you will be able to easily kill them now that you possess so much information about their species.#But enough talk. The bright future is built with actions, not words. And humanity has waited too long for it to wait a moment more...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_LOSS2        | Humanity now awaits a future others will shape.#The Galactic Council election has ended. The Leader of the Galaxy has been elected to create a new age, and it was not you.#While it is very much possible that %5 may very well lead the galaxy into a bright and prosperous future as you promised to, you cannot help but to be dissapointed that human civilization has not dominated the galaxy, but remained obscure and failed to grasp the one opportunity to take control.#It is quite clear that what this new age entails will certainly derail the protoutopian human society you have created and your plans for the future.#But wallowing in self-pity is not the human way. It is the way of cowards and fools. You will push on, endure and make the best of this situation. After all, it could be worse: you could have rejected this new age, and in their self-righteousness, drew the ire of the rest of the galaxy, thus causing the complete and total extinction of the human race...
GAME_OVER_ALLIANCE_WIN2           | Humanity now rules the galaxy with an invisible hand.#%5, leader of the %6 race, your allies, has been elected as Leader of the Galaxy. Enjoying and reveling in the power he now wields, he need not be aware he is but a pawn in your grand plan.#Humanity has been put in an incredibly favourable position. With you being a trusted friend of %5, you will find being able to influence his decisions and cloud his judgement toward your purposes incredibly easy, while since you are simply a friend, are completely free from any consequences your influence might cause.#In the meantime you will switch to your long-forgotten project of creating a utopian society, and when the time is right and the idea is perfected, spread it through the entire galaxy...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_LOSS2         | You have failed yourself, your colleagues and humanity.#The human race is dead. Completely and absolutely. It was killed, murdered even, by hostile alien powers, for the crime of wanting to maintain it's sovereignty and not be ruled over by others.#This fate was sealed when the Galactic Council elected %5 to rule over the galaxy as Leader of the New Republic. You knew that %5 was a liar and could not be trusted. Trying to act in the best interests of humanity, you rejected this tyrannical regime. You hoped others would see what you saw in %5 and support your rebellion, yet no such thing occured, and you were alone, against the whole galaxy. Needless to say, you did not win.#Even though your actions led to it's demise, the rest of humankind beared you no ill will. After all, a quick death like this was surely better than whatever future humanity would suffer under the tyrannical rule of the %6 race. You died smiling. As the last of the Federal vaults' thick doors were opened and laser fire came pouring in, you knew that humanity would die free. And with that thought, your tale was over, as you detonated the warhead deep in your last fortress, taking the alien soldiers with you...
GAME_OVER_REBELLION_WIN2          | Human civilization utterly dominates this galaxy!#Against all odds, you have succeeded. Humanity has fought against the entirety of the known galaxy and won, a feat some would have said was impossible.#You remember how you tried to reason and explain your decision to not join this new Republic and the only response you heard was uniform laughing and sneering. Now, years later, that event would become the last transmission the inhabitants of the last remaining hiding places of those alien races ever received. Now it humanity that laughs and sneers.#With other races out of the way, you are now free to pursue the improvement of society and the quality of life, and you are certain that with the amazing technologies researched during this period of interstellar expansion you will be able to achieve much.#And after that, humanity will expand and dominate other galaxies, their resources and knowledge becoming humanity's resources and knowledge. At that point, humanity will turn truly unstoppable: a force so great that it cannot be stopped no matter the effort expended...
GAME_OVER_REBEL_ALLIANCE_WIN2     | Humanity's enemies are crushed!#The war against the New Republic is finally over. Humanity won, but not alone. You were helped by your allies, those who understood that only you would be able to lead the galaxy to a prosperous and peaceful future.#Together you destroyed the last remnants of the New Republic and now control the galaxy.#A new age begins: an age of rebuilding, of progress, industry, technology and exploration of the rest of the universe. While great intergalactic ark ships are already undergoing construction, you will stay in this galaxy to create a truly Utopian society, perfect, without issues, for both humanity and it's allies, for they no doubt have earned it...
GAME_OVER_DIPLOMATIC_WIN2         | Human civilization peacefully dominates this galaxy.#The new galactic order of the New Republic has begun, and with it, a new era. The age of aggression and war is over - now is the age of understanding and peace.#Of course, this peace will not come simply because you say it has. You will need the fleets to keep all in line initially, as well as to secure the intergalactic colonization programs you have started. But force will only work for so long - as soon as you complete it, you will use your model of utopian society as an incentive to be part of the New Republic. After that, pampered and entertained, the lesser races will never resist humanity's dominance ever again. Of course, you will still keep the plans for a truly utopian society to yourself and to humanity, for superiors deserve better than those they control.#In the meantime, this galaxy, though not yet utopian, still has much prosperity to enjoy, and will have even more once you finish your work. But for now, you can simply relax and enjoy the power you wield for the time being. After all, you have all the time in the universe now, that all the threats to humanity have been turned irrelevant...
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_WIN2       | Human civilization has crushed all opposition.#The rebellion against your new galactic order was unexpected. But as with all previous threats to humanity, you dealt with it - swiftly and efficiently. While no physical traces of the rebellion remained, in the interests of future stability you took care to remove any mention of it from all known galactic databases as well as forbidding it's mention.#With the rebellion that never existed out of the way, you will now lead the galaxy toward a bright future.#You already had your suspicions, but the non-existent rebellion finally proved that the alien races were too much of a liability. And so, the current generation of aliens will be the last - through extensive birth control programs, propaganda and sterilizing agents in the nutrient supplies, you will make sure the future will be human.#And so after that matter is taken care of, you will change your focus to improving human society even further, as well as expanding toward other galaxies so that the glory of humanity may expand as far as possible.#But that is the long game you have chosen to play. For now while you still have to wait, you might as well relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor...
GAME_OVER_NEW_REPUBLIC_LOSS2      | You have failed yourself, your colleagues and humanity.#This was not how you expected this to end. The new age was to be the culmination of all previous galactic history, the end-point of all interstellar civilization that would bring harmony and prosperity. How ironic that it brought only a galactic war that caused so much destruction and death.#You do not understand why a rebellion could win against the combined forces of the entire galaxy. By all calculations and estimations, it was you that should have won this war. Yet, you have not. The rebels have exterminated the human race and though it achieved complete victory.#The only thing you could do in your final moments was wonder what lead to this and how did this happen. Alas, you will now never receive an answer to those burning questions now that your conciousness has left this world...
