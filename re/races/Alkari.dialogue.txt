CONTACT_HONORABLE          | I, God-Emperor of the [my_race] people, [my_name] greet you, [your_nameTitle] [your_name]. I look forward to a bright future for [my_race_plural] and [your_race_plural] alike. 
CONTACT_PACIFIST           | Greetings! I am the God-Emperor [my_name] of the [my_race] people. It is my desire for both the [my_race] and [your_race] races to coexist in peace and cooperation. 
CONTACT_ERRATIC            | I am the sole leader of the glorious [my_empire] which has existed for many years. I greet you in the name of the [my_race] people. You call yourself the [your_race], do you not?

//
GREETING_01                | Greetings. How may I and the [my_race] people help you?
GREETING_04                | Hello. Please be brief, for I have many other matters to attend to.
GREETING_07                | You test my patience contacting the Empire! State your demands, and state them now!

//
DECLAREWAR_HATE_01         | Even though I consider peace and cooperation to be the best ways to succeed, the existence of your species throws a wrench in my plans. Prepare to have your kind eradicated, [your_race].
DECLAREWAR_HATE_02         | While every species lost during this period of galactic chaos is very much regrettable, I and my advisors have deemed the removal of your species necessary. Step by step it will be done, until every [your_race] is destroyed.
DECLAREWAR_HATE_03         | It should have been obvious from the very beginning that peaceful co-existence between our peoples was impossible. Alas, poor [your_race], if only one of our species can exist in this galaxy, I will do everything in my power to ensure it will be the [my_race]!
//
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_01      | War is inescapable in this galaxy. One must be prepared for it. But alas, simulations can only be so accurate. Sometimes real, physical training is more effective. In this case, it will be a war against your species, [your_race].
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_02      | It is clear that this galaxy cannot decide on who will lead it to a glorious, prosperous, peaceful future. Let this leader be chosen by force, so that both our peoples shall battle, until only one is left. The one which remains will be the one most fit to rule this galaxy.
DECLAREWAR_ERRATIC_03      | I have concluded that your people are far too weak to survive in this galaxy. To destroy you now is not only to deny the mad warmongers resources, but an act of mercy that will free your people from the suffering that will occur, [your_race].
//
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_01     | All of my preparation for galactic unification will be useless if the Empire is not spread out into the galaxy sufficiently! If the Empire cannot expand peacefully, it will expand aggressively!
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_02     | All the resources of this galaxy must be utilized to unite it, peacefully or less so. I can't help but notice you hold quite a few resource-rich worlds which are not used for that goal. The Empire shall correct this, with force.
DECLAREWAR_MILITARY_03     | My newest calculations at just what will be required for my plans for galactic unification to succeed say that the Empire's current size is simply not enough for that. This must be rectified. With military force.
//
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_01     | Alliances are the way the Empire will unify this galaxy! If a war with you is required to preserve the Empire's alliance with the [other_empire], then I will pay that price gladly.
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_02     | The Empire does not make promises it does not hold, [your_race]. We promised to help our ally in matters of war and now is our time to do so, by declaring a war on your empire.
DECLAREWAR_ALLIANCE_03     | We have not ignored the changes to your relationship with the [other_empire]. In fact, we have been watching the situation very closely, and now it is our time to interfere, by declaring war on your empire.
//
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_01       | Perhaps you thought that you could get away with this. Perhaps you thought that the only response you would get from the Empire would be a strongly worded letter. You could not have been more inaccurate. 
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_02       | Some said I am a hypocrite for condeming your kind for spying on mine when I am doing the exact same thing. They are dead now, just as you will be soon enough for thinking you could spy on the Empire and get away with it!
DECLAREWAR_SPYING_03       | The Empire cannot show weakness by ignoring this kind of behavior! A war with you will show the other races what happens to those who think they can take advantage of the Empire!
//
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_01       | So be it. Attacking so brazenly shows your true intentions for what they are: causing death and destruction! The Empire will respond accordingly. 
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_02       | The Empire will not tolerate this kind of behavior! Prepare for war!
DECLAREWAR_ATTACK_03       | If war is what you desire, then fear not, the Empire will provide it to you, war of the highest caliber.
//
DECLAREWAR_OPPORTUNITY_01  | Every opportunity to further the Empire's power in this galaxy must be taken. Unfortunately, this one requires the [your_race] species to simply... cease existing. 
DECLAREWAR_ASSASSIN_01     | I and the political leadership of the Empire have been looking for an excuse to start a war with your race for quite some time now. I believe we just found one.




OFFER_PEACE_01             | Both of our peoples must now understand that this war is taking our attention away from focusing on the things that really matter. Let us sign this peace treaty, [your_name], to prevent any further conflict.
OFFER_TRADE_01             | You must realize that this is not a zero-sum game, [your_name]. We can both prosper in mutual cooperation, and I think the best way to do exactly that is to sign a trade agreement set at [amt] BC. What do you think, [your_name]?
OFFER_PACT_01              | The continued trade between both our races proves that we can prosper together, [your_name]. However, peace is still not certain. Why not rectify this mistake by signing a Non-Aggression Pact? What is your response?
OFFER_ALLIANCE_01          | Our Pact and strong trade treaty show that both our races can live together in peaceful coexistence, [your_name]. I think it is time to take our relationship to the next level by forming an Alliance. What is your response?
WARN_TRESPASSING_01        | [my_race] space is called [my_race] space for a reason, [your_race]. Send your fleets away to your own planets, or else.
WARN_EXPANSION_01          | Such quick expansion is troubling. Every empire needs worlds, but you do not stop even though you have enough. If you continue expanding at your present rate, well, the galaxy might not react well...
WARN_BUILDUP_01            | Did you really think you could intimidate the Empire with that starfleet of yours? You are most mistaken. Now, I suggest you stop boasting, otherwise the consequences could be... unfortunate, for you that is.
WARN_SKIRMISH_01           | Did you really think you could just attack our fleets without consequences, [your_race]? Luckily for you, the Empire is willing to give you a second chance and forget this ever happened, if you return your fleets back to your colonies and do not commit any more attacks.
WARN_ATTACKED_01           | The recent space battle between [my_race] and [your_race] fleets must be a lone incident, [your_race]. Otherwise I fear war will break out, and I think neither one of us wants that.
WARN_INVADED_01            | Your unprovoked open invasion of [system] is something that I did not expect, even from a race like yours, [your_race]. If hostilities continue then war will be the only possible outcome.
WARN_ESPIONAGE_01          | Spies were recently discovered in the Empire. [your_race] spies, trying to steal [my_race] technology. I personally let the spy go this time, but I may not be as forgiving next time, [your_name]. [framed]
WARN_SABOTAGE_01           | Several installations recently went offline in the Empire, along with [your_race] spies being discovered near them. What were you thinking?! Do you want to start a war between our peoples?! If you know what is good for you, you will put an end to this now, [your_name]!
WARN_BIOWEAPON_01          | Those bioweapons are truly nightmarish. To give those poor civilians such a horrific end... Monsters! Savages! If only you yourself felt a fraction of the suffering you caused this day!
WARN_GENOCIDE_01           | Perhaps it was necessary. Perhaps the extermination of the [victim_race] race was the correct long-term decision. Even if it was, the fact that you were able of achieving such a feat alone is grounds enough for concern.
WARN_FINAL_WAR_01          | After centuries of bloodshed and conflict, the galaxy is finally united. Every species finally understanding the need to unify, ready to work towards a better future, together. Except yours. The solution is obvious, a final war to extinction between the New Republic and the [rebel_empire]!
WARN_COUNCIL_VOTE_01       | How could you not vote for me in the Galactic Council?! Do you not see that without the [my_empire] to guide this galaxy it will be forever doomed to chaos?! I will remember this, [your_name].
WARN_OATHBREAKER_01        | How do you expect us to conduct diplomacy with you if you cannot even be trusted? The Empire does not like when it is lied to, [your_name].
WARN_ATTACKED_ALLY_01      | We have seen your skirmishes with the [defender_race_plural]. You will stop, or else the Empire will be forced to unleash it's starfleets to defend the [defender_race_plural], as our Alliance requires.
WARN_REBELLING_AGAINST_01  | No! How could this be?! The [my_race] Empire should have united the galaxy under it's banner this very moment and moved forward to a brighter future! But instead, YOU were elected! I may have to correct this, with military force, should it continue being this way!
 

PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_01     | It is a good thing that there are those who realize the need for the Empire to unite this galaxy. Rest assured, I will not forget your contributions, [your_name].
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_02     | The Empire thanks you for voting in it's favour at the Galactic Council. The bright future we wish to share with all other races can only be achieved with the help of exemplary races such as yours.
PRAISE_COUNCIL_VOTE_03     | Well, that was unexpected. Are you trying to manipulate our opinion of you or do you genuinely believe in our vision for the future? Only time will tell...

PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_01   | The Empire was right to have you as it's ally, [your_name]. Those [defender_race_plural] stand no chance against both our empires, and your recent successful attack proves that.
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_02   | It is very interesting how a common enemy can help create new friendships. I think when this war is over both of us should discuss how we can... help each other's peoples.
PRAISE_ATTACKED_ENEMY_03   | So, the [your_race_plural] have joined our war against the [defender_race_plural]? Not something the Empire expected, yet if we will need to waste less [my_race] lives this can be allowed...

PRAISE_TRADE_01            | Our mutually beneficial trade agreenment has been most helpful
PRAISE_TRADE_02            | There are many ways to prove one's honor, ambassador. Conducting business fairly and in good faith is one of the best ways to do so, and the Sovereignty values it highly from those we encounter in this galaxy. 

PRAISE_REBELLING_WITH_01     | Those brutes on the council underestimate us, ambassador! Together we will show them what the term "fatal misstep" truly means! 

DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_01           | How may our empire serve you?
DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_02           | Please end communications as soon as your concerns are dealt with.
DIPLO_MAIN_MENU_03           | ...
