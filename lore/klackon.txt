The klackons in this mod are a collective consciousness like in vanilla rotp but has no sense of "I". The Hive always refers to itself as just "The Hive" and speaks about itself in third person. It has trouble understanding or does not care enough to understand the fact that other races are not hive minds and have individuals with various opinions on issues, and always calls others by their species.

The Hive inhabits many small hives, cramped structures built with only efficiency in mind. Hive drones completely lack intellect. They communicate by subtly changing the color of their eyes and releasing chemicals. The main food sources for the Hive are its own dead drones and other kinds of biomass.

Hive drones will readily sacrifice themselves for the good of the Hive, just as the Hive itself will sacrifice them if necessary, with no conditioning required.
