Humans - intro and some dialogue done. They have more lore. Survivors of a nuclear holocaust in an alternate 1994, the Human Federation is a human supremacist semi-xenophobic technocratic oligarchy that has eliminated almost all culture of the Old World and replaced it with their own philosophy which is inspired by Warhammer 40k's Imperial Truth.

Alkari - intro and most of the dialogue done. The Alkari Empire is led by the Emperor, a mysterious being who is allegedly immortal. Centuries ago, when the Alkari were in a primitive state, the Emperor united Altair under a single banner in the incredibly destructive "Great Crusades" and became the sole leader of Alkari civilization. Under his leadership, technological progress skyrocketed and in just 3 centuries the Alkari became a space-faring race.

Silicoids - intro almost done. The Silicoid Matrix is comprised of the Silicoids. They are strange beings who eat rock and soil to get trace amounts of nuclear elements like thorium which their bodies turn into energy. They see consuming other organisms for survival abominable and thus do not particularly like other forms of life. The Silicoids use nuclear energy in almost everything they create, which intentionally releases heavy amounts of radiation onto their worlds, but for the Silicoids, who can absorb it for energy it is not a problem but rather a boon.

Rather than a conventional brain, the Silicoids have what is closer to a biomechanical computer. The sheer unlikelihood of them forming naturally leads many spiritualist individuals throughout the galaxy to use the existence of the Silicoids as proof of a higher being. Ironically, the Silicoids themselves are hardline atheists and do not believe there can be anything objectively superior to their species.
