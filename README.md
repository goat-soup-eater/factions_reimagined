# factions_reimagined
This mod replaces writing for the races in the game Remnants of the Precursors. 

The process is quite long so the mod only changes the writing for the Klackon for now, but eventually will change the writing for all (or most) races in the game.

How to install:

 - Press the green button labeled Code and then the smaller one labeled Download ZIP.
 - Create a copy of Remnants.jar in a separate folder, to prevent accidental damage to the game, if you are installing the mod for the first time.
 - Open Remnants.jar with an archive tool (WinRar, 7-Zip, etc.)
 - Go to rotp/lang.
 - Extract the downloaded zip file, go to more_flavor_text-master/. 
  - Add the folder re and the languages.txt file to the archive.
 - Run the game and choose Reimagined Races as your language. Done!
